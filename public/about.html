<h1> About me </h1>
<p>I would introduce myself in seven words. Passionate coder, responsible mother, best colleague ever.
     That pretty much sums it up, though at least the last one my former colleagues have to confirm.
      I try to do a good job in all roles I have in life, and I enjoy the process immensely.

    I’d introduce myself as a dreamer. I dream of working at Google, 
    working on applications billions of people use, having an impact on the world with my work.
     Sure enough, I know you receive hundreds of job applications for every single job opening, and 
     I am not the only dreamer waiting for his chance. But I will try to convince you in this meeting that 
     I am the one who deserves a chance to prove his skills in the job…
